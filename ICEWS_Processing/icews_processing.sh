# 1. raw_data/text_to_CAMEO_mod.py (takes raw events files from Dataverse, runs them through Phil Schrodt's text to CAMEO python script (with a few modifications from me), and outputs .txt files with several things fixed. I manually moved those to the post_python folder)
# 2. icews_cleanup.R (merges files in post_python into a single, and merges in group names for individuals using the ICEWS actor dicitionary from Dataverse (post_python/icews.actors.20140112.csv), outputting a single csv with the complete ICEWS data, icews_with_groups.csv).
# 3. each of the .R files in cleanup_by_country, which take icews_with_groups.csv as their input, and produce a subset of events that includes only interactions between dissident groups in that country (or conflict, if a country has multiple). This entails removing actors that are not dissidents, and assigning events that name individuals as actors to the groups (a single event can be counted for multiple groups if an individual has multiple memberships). Additionally, I calculate the dates during which a group is part of the dissident network. These files produce two outputs: one in the output/nodes directory, with the spells of time for which a group is part of the dissident network. The other in outpu/edges, which is events that occur between dissidents. I may fix this asymmetry at a later point.
# 4. From here, go to the Network_Creation directory.
